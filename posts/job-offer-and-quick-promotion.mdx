# **How I Received a Job Offer and a Quick Promotion from a Remote Company**

<br />

One morning, right before starting my usual work, I received a message from an unknown number.
I almost ignored it, but curiosity won. As I read further, it turned out to be a **job offer for a remote software engineering position**.

<br />

It felt surreal, because of no interviews, no tests, and I hadn’t even graduated yet at that time.
Since my current job operated in the morning and this new role was in the evening, I decided to take both.
Yes, it meant **sacrificing more of my personal time**, but it also meant **learning, growing, and earning**.

<br />

## **But the Question Is: How Did I Get Offered by SCHNAP?**

After some time talking with my Lead and especially after I got promoted, gaining more responsibility over their systems. I realized a few things:

• My company was using **AI Agents**. In this case, the agents used the **LinkedIn API** and **OpenAI** to find and analyze candidate data that was valuable to them.

• That means **I was the most valuable candidate at that time** hehe.

<br />

## **What Made Me the Most Valuable Candidate?**

• I’m just applying of concept **T-shaped Software Engineer (Fullstack)**, but I specialize in **Automation** (Zapier, Make.com, n8n) and **AI Integration**.

• I aligned perfectly with the company’s focus areas likes **Data, ETL, and AI Engineering**.

• I **optimized my social media** profiles using the right **keywords and content strategy**.

<br />

## **So, What About The Quick Promotion? What Happen?**

After 2 months, i'm working there, i don't take so long to adapt the environment and make a good relation between me, Lead, and the Boss (But, i'm not licking them or anything bad). This is just small development team (10 People of E-Commerce, 4 of them Developer including myself).

<br />

I forgot when i got contacted again by my Boss. That He, Lead, and me invited to vacation to Dinner in Jakarta and then a week free vacation in Bali (OMG)!!!. So, don't take to long to answer and thinking, you must already know what i will answer right?

**Yes**, i don't take the invitation hehe.

<br />

I'm to shy and introvert to just go vacation with another people (at that time also many rumors that many foreigner invites indonesian to go vacation but they take the indonesian organs and sell it ☠️).

<br />

And then i just invited to Online Meeting because i'm not going to Bali. So, the news My Boss said he likes with my works, my effort, and the contribution is going well. But, he doesn't want me to still works with another company. So, there is negotiation and i get my quick promotion in just 2 months of working.

<br />

## **The Conclusion**

Optimize your personal branding and make yourself visible to the world. Also don't just working without a path, but keep finishing problem by making a solution that worth.

_Thank you so much for your attention._
