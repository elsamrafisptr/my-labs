summary: 'Hello World! This is my first time writing for a blog post.'

I don't know why I started writing. Actually, I like writing and pouring my thoughts into words and imagination, but sometimes I feel limited because I am also an ["introvert"](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/am-i-an-introvert), which makes me not very confident, and a perfectionist, which makes me afraid of doing things imperfectly.

<br />
But, screw that, ***Hello World!*** The first sentence in learning IT, let's write and
share!
<br />
Thanks!
